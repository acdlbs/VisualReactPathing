# Static site used to visualize pathing algorithms
I created this repo gain a better understanding of react, as well as the most commonly used pathing algorithms.

https://acdlbs.github.io/VisualReactPathing/

# Structure
- Tile.js
  Where logic for the individual tiles resides. 
- PathingGrid.js
  Pathing algorithm and display logic. 

# To run
to run locally:
1. clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

# TODO
- add maze generator
- add more algorithms (currently dijkstra's is implemented)
